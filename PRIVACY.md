# Privacy Policy for Link Summarizer Chrome Extension

*Last updated: September 30, 2025*
*Generated by ChatGPT*

## 1. Introduction

The Link Summarizer extension (the “Extension”) is developed and maintained by Ravit Sharma (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and share information when you install and use the Extension.

By installing or using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Extension.

## 2. What the Extension Does & How It Works

The Extension allows users to hover over hyperlinks on webpages and view summaries generated by a large language model (LLM), e.g. OpenAI or Google Gemini, according to the user’s choice and configuration.

* Users can configure an API key (OpenAI or Gemini) in the extension’s popup settings.
* Users can adjust the desired summary length (e.g. from 10 to 200 words).
* Users can toggle the summarization functionality (ON/OFF).
* All API keys, settings, and preferences are stored locally in the browser (using Chrome’s storage).
* The extension listens to link hover events on pages where it is enabled, sends the link URL or its content (or excerpt) to the chosen LLM API, and displays the summary.

It does **not** (unless you modify it) explicitly collect personal identifiers or track users across sites.

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Data You Provide

* **API Keys & Preferences**. You supply an API key (for OpenAI or Gemini) and your preferences (e.g. summary length, toggle state).
* **Link Data**. When you hover over a hyperlink, the Extension may (with your consent) send the URL or the link target’s content or a portion thereof to the LLM API to generate the summary.

### 3.2 Data Automatically Collected

We do **not** collect analytics, usage telemetry, or personal identifiers by default (unless you add instrumentation). The Extension does **not** phone home by default.

### 3.3 Local Storage

Your API keys, preferences, and settings are stored locally in the browser (via Chrome’s secure storage) and not sent to our servers.

## 4. Use of Information

We use the information as follows:

* To generate summaries: the URL or excerpt is passed to the LLM API to compute the summary.
* To save your configuration and preferences (locally).
* To enable or disable the summarization feature based on your toggle settings.

We do **not** use your data for profiling, advertising, or tracking.

## 5. Data Sharing & Disclosure

We do **not** share or disclose your API keys, preferences, or link data to third parties, except in the following limited cases:

* If required by law (e.g. court order).
* To enforce our rights or protect users or security.
* If you separately choose to send or share summaries or logs (e.g. by copying summary text yourself).

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade your personal data.

## 6. Data Retention

Because all data (API keys, link data) is processed locally by default, there is no central storage or long-term retention by us. The only retention is in your browser’s extension storage, until you uninstall or clear data.

If you elect (in a modified version) to log usage locally or upload logs, retention would follow the policies described in that version.

## 7. Security

* API keys and settings are stored locally using Chrome’s secure storage APIs.
* Communications to LLM APIs should use HTTPS to protect confidentiality.
* We do not store user personal data on servers.
* However, no system is perfectly secure; you should treat your API keys carefully.

## 8. Third-Party Services

When you choose to use the OpenAI or Gemini LLM backends, your link data or excerpts are transmitted to those external APIs. Their own privacy policies apply to how they handle the data you send them.

We encourage you to review OpenAI’s and Google’s privacy policies to understand how they process your requests and data.

## 9. Your Rights & Choices

* You can disable or enable the summarization toggle anytime.
* You can uninstall the Extension (which clears stored settings).
* You can change or remove your API key in settings.
* Because we do not collect centralized logs, there is minimal data for us to delete on your behalf.
* If you believe we hold any personal data about you (in a modified version), you may request deletion or correction.

## 10. Children

This Extension is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally (for example, when adding new features or modifying behavior). We will update the “Last updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
